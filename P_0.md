## Sign in Fanshawe Webadvisor
 - notice the form attribute:
    `<form name="datatelform" method="post" autocomplete="OFF" acction onsubmit="javascript:disableButton('SUBMIT2');">`
 - notice there are two hidden input element:
    `<input type="hidden" name="RETURN.URL" value="https://webadvisor.fanshawec.ca/WebAdvisor/WebAdvisor?TYPE=M&amp;PID=CORE-WBMAIN&amp;TOKENIDX=4840644578">`
    `<input type="hidden" name="SUBMIT_OPTIONS" value="">`
 - there is a key name "MIME Type" that I cannot find in html. But I decide to ignore it. Let's have a try first.

## How open the website

I find the first problem isn't how to sign in, but is how to open the website. Those website is not only the html + css, but also the javascript. If we cannot run the javascript, then is inpossible to have a complete view about the page.

Then we need the Selenium Python.

##  Sign in Fanshawe WEbadvisor by Selenium

```python
myName = xxxx
myKey = xxxx

form = drivr.find_element(By.CLASS_NAME, "screen")
form.find_element(By.NAME, "USER.NAME").send_keys(myName)
form.find_element(By.NAME, "CURR.PWD").send_keys(myKey)
form.submit()
```

```python
for x in hrefList:
    if x.text == "Student":
        href = x

href.click()

```

```python
for x in hrefList:
    if x.text == "Class Schedule List":
        href = x
